Frames:
    Port cassowary
    Insertions
    Variable height frames
    Balanced frames

  Then set maxheight, and try typesetting into frame b

Plan of attack for balanced frames:
  If total vertical list contributions > total of remaining balanced frames - full page, ship as normal
  If vertical list contribution ends with VPenalty(MAGIC_NUMBER)
