Input                   --> Frame/Layer model --> Flowing/shaping engine --> output

Frame and flow:
	Balanced/unbalanced frames
		Balanced frames are implemented by treating them as a single frame and dividing the lengths by the count
	Absolute/relative position
	Flowed / floated (with ID)
		What happens when a floated frame is defined mid-flow?
			Stop the flowed frame where it is and output it.
